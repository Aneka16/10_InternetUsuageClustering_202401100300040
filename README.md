# 10_InternetUsuageClustering_202401100300040
This project analyzes internet users by clustering based on browsing behavior, then classifying them if user types are known. It uses metrics like device usage and site visits to uncover patterns and predict user categories, aiding in personalization and platform optimization.
# Features(Algorithm used)
Unsupervised Learning using KMeans to cluster users.
Data Preprocessing with scaling and train/test splitting.
Performance Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.
Visualizations: Scatter plots and cluster distributions.
# Result
KMeans Clustering Output
After applying KMeans with 3 clusters:

Cluster Counts:
Cluster 0: 45 users
Cluster 1: 38 users
Cluster 2: 17 users
Each user was grouped based on usage patterns like device time, visit frequency, and site categories (e.g., Social Media, Shopping). This helps in identifying different types of users, such as:

Cluster 0: Light Users

Cluster 1: Heavy Social Media Users

Cluster 2: Online Shoppers
